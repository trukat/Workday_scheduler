# Workday_scheduler

## Homework 5

For this assignment, a work day calendar was created for normal business hours: 9AM - 5 PM

* The date is shown in the header using moment.js
* Time blocks are color-coded to display past hours (red), present (gray), or future (green)
* Each time block allows the user to enter their task/event and 'saves' the input to local storage.
* The application uses jquery and Bootstrap for styling.
